This is a simple JavaFX GUI to communicate with an Oracle sql database.

If you wish to run the application in your machine then simply edit the Connect() and populateTables() methods accordingly:
Connect():
          Change the String dbURL to connect with whatever server you have available ( In my case I connected it to a local sql server)
          
PopulateTables():
          When pointing the scanner to the populate_tables.txt file(second line of the method), Change the directory to where populate_tables.txt file is stored in your machine.
          
bless up
